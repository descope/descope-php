## Overview

The Descope SDK for PHP provides convenient access to Descope authentication. You can read more on the [Descope Website](https://descope.com).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [PHP 8.1+](https://www.php.net/)

### Installation

Install the package with `Composer`:

```
composer require descope/descope-php
```

You'll need to set up a `.env` file in the root directory with your Descope Project ID, which you can get from the [Console](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) like this:

```
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=<Descope Project ID>
```

## Using the SDK

In order to use the SDK you will need to initialize a `DescopeSDK` object with your Descope Project ID you defined in your `.env` file, like this:

```
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Descope\SDK\DescopeSDK;

$descopeSDK = new DescopeSDK([
    'projectId' => $_ENV['DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID']
]);
```

This SDK will easily allow you to handle Descope JWT tokens with the following built in functions:

1. `DescopeSDK->verify($sessionToken)` - will validate the JWT signature and return either **TRUE** or **FALSE**, depending on if the JWT is valid and expired
2. `DescopeSDK->getClaims($sessionToken)` - will return all of the claims from the JWT in an array format
3. `DescopeSDK->getUserDetails($refreshToken)` - will return all of the user information (email, phone, verification status, etc.) using a provided refresh token

> **Note**: To use verify() and getClaims(), you will need to pass in your session token into the function argument. To use getUserDetails() to will need to pass in your refresh token.

## Unit Testing

The PHP directory includes unit testing using PHPUnit. You can insert values for session token and refresh tokens in the `src/tests/DescopeSDKTest.php` file, and run to validate whether or not the functions are operating properly.

To run the tests, run this command:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose src/tests/DescopeSDKTest.php
```

## Other Code Samples

1. [PHP Sample App](https://github.com/descope/php-sdk/sample/)
2. [WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/wordpress-plugin)

## Running the PHP Sample App

Run this command, from the root directory, to install the necessary dependencies and start the sample app:

```
php -S localhost:3000 -t sample/
```

The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ from your web browser.
